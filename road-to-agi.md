title:  "Road to AGI v0.1"
---
The following is a list of challenges that need to be solved to achieve Artificial General Intelligence. This roadmap is meant to be a living document that will be updated over time as we learn more about AGI. [[what?]](https://maraoz.com/2022/10/31/agi-roadmap/)

This list is collaborative, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/maraoz/maraoz.github.io/edit/master/road-to-agi.md).
